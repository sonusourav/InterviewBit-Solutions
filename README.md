## General Information
The repository contains solutions to various [problems](https://www.interviewbit.com/dashboard/) on interviewbit. The code is merely a snippet (as solved on InterviewBit) & hence is not executable in a java compiler.
<br/>

## Contribution Guidelines
All the solutions must pass all the test cases on the InterviewBit website.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork this repository 
2. Create an issue.
3. Make a pull request and wait for it to be merged.

### When to contribute?

1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size.
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method but is more clear and easy to understand then, comment your solution in the main file & make a pull request.
